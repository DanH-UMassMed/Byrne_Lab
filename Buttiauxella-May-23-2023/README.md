The raw data contains 3 repeats of 3 samples of worms. 

1. N2 fed control OP50 e. coli, 
2. N2 fed Buttiauxella 1 (protects against degeneration) 
3. N2 fed Buttiauxella 2 (does not protect against degeneration). 

Our idea is that we might be able to reduce noise by including two bacteria from the same genus, only one of which induces our phenotype of interest. So, ideally we would identify a reasonable number of candidate genes that are only differentially regulated on the protective diet.
